			Hello, my name is Evelyn Schiefelbein, and I am a freshman at the University of Georgia. I am from 
			Sugar Hill, Georgia near Buford and am 19 years old. I am an accounting major in Terry’s College
			of Business. Back home I have younger brother in high school as a freshman, and a yorkie named Coco.</p>
			<p class="tab">
			Although I am currently not working while at college, I do have a job back home at Daddy O’Brien’s 
			Irish Ice Cream and Pub. I first began working with the owners Lori (Mommy’O) and Frank (Daddy’O) O’Brien 
			in August of 2016 while they were still running their business out of ice cream carts at various local 
			food truck nights, festivals, and corporate events. Once their storefront opened in Sugar Hill, I became 
			a server and worked there until the day before I came to UGA.</p>
			<p class="tab">
			DaddyO’s is a very unique concept and I believe that no ice cream parlor can beat theirs. They serve 
			sandwiches, soups, breakfast food, and best of all, ice cream. What makes their ice cream so special is 
			that it is homemade with almost no preservatives, and the adult line of flavors is infused with ice cream.
			My personal favorite non-alcoholic flavor is <I>O’Crunch</I>. Below is a few of over a hundred ice creams 
			flavors they make. In additon, below are some of the awards they have won nationally for their Ice Cream.
			Click <a href="https://daddyosicecream.com/">here</a> to see more flavors on their official website.
